    Implementing a microservice seems to be a fine solution to spread responsibility among several contributers.
    Nevertheless, there are some challenges to consider. The PoolÂ² address such challenges by the following concepts.
    Each concept explains the addressed challenge and a possible solution.
    <ul>
      {concepts.map(concept => (
        <li key={concept.slug}>
          <Link to={`/concepts/${concept.slug}/`}>{concept.title}</Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  </div>
))
