# Guide: Edit the documentation
This page is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and you can pull the project as [repository](https://github.com/Viva-con-Agua/Viva-con-Agua.github.io).
The page is implemented using [react-static](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static) using the [markdown template](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static/tree/master/examples/markdown).
Thus we can use [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to write the documentation and [React](https://reactjs.org/) to present it.

## Getting started
Pull the repository, add or edit a markdown file in `content/collection/posts/`. Commit and post your changes to the repository
and your changes will be visible on [https://viva-con-agua.github.io/](https://viva-con-agua.github.io/).
