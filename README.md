# React-Static - Markdown Example

This example is the most basic version of react-static available with support for markdown content. It includes:
- Babel
- CSS imports
- Image imports
- File imports
- Automatic Routing
- Markdown content with [jdown](https://github.com/DanWebb/jdown)

[danwebb.co](https://danwebb.co) is built using jdown and [React Static](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static) so see the static.config.js file in the [websites github repo](https://github.com/DanWebb/danwebb.co) for a real world example.
